Specifying program variabiles

* network:
Beysian Network must be given as a json file. It must follow the structure given in the task description. The program assumes that given network is correct.

* Markov Blanket


* MCMC with Gibbs sampling algorithm

Given evidence value must be set in the same way as probabilites!
For instance:

"node": {
    "probabilities": { "A": 0.70, "B": 0.30 }
}

evidence = {"node": "A"}
evidence={"burglary": "T", "alarm": "T"}
evidence={"flower_species": "rose"}, query=["color"]
